function new_area = check_for_crosses(area)
% Purpose: Check if the sides of the polygon crosses each other, and if
% they do, return a new polygon without crossing sides
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
% area: A list of points determining a polygon. The points must encircle
% the polygon in positive rotation

%% OUTPUT
% new_area: A polygon where no sides crosses each other

%% CODE

if n == 3

cross_points = zeros(n, 2);

% a vector which indicates if a point is positioned outside the polygon
