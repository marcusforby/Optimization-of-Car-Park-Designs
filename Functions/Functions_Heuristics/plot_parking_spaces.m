function plot_parking_spaces(points, area, parking_size, outedges)
% Purpose: plots the car park that has been designed
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
%       points: a list of points which we need to plot. The first and 
%               second entries are the x- and y- coordinates of the center 
%               of the parking-slot, the third entry indicates which angle 
%               the parking slot is rotated, and the fourth indicates 
%               which side should be used to enter the slot
%         area: a list of points defining the parking space, in positive  
%               direction of rotation
% parking_size: the dimensions of a parking slot. The first entry is width,
%               the second is height and the third is need free space in 
%               front of the car
