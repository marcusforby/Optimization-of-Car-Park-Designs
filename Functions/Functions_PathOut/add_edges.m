function [X_temp, Y_temp, edges] = add_edges(X_temp, Y_temp, interval, end_point, X, Y, edges)
% Purpose: Add edges between the new nodes
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
% X_temp: x-coordinates for all the new and old nodes in the grid
% Y_temp: y-coordinates for all the new and old nodes in the grid
% interval: distance between the nodes in the grid
% end_point: list of points from which we can exit the parking lot
% X: x-coordinates for all the old nodes in the grid
% Y: y-coordinates for all the old nodes in the grid
% edges: the current list of edges

%% OUTPUT
% edges: list of edges containing both old and new edges
