function [X, Y] = add_remove_XY(X, Y, X_start, Y_start, parking_size, chosen_points, points, road_width)
% Purpose: Add nodes to the grid, and remove the ones conflicting with
% chosen_points
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
% X: x-coordinates for all the nodes in the grid
% Y: y-coordinates for all the nodes in the grid
% X_start: the x-coordinates of all original grid
% Y_start: the y-coordinates of all original grid
% parking_size: the sizes of the parking-slots
% chosen_points: indices of the points which we should remove nodes around
% points: the centers of all parking slots
% road_width: the width which is needed for the car to drive

%% OUTPUT
% X: x-coordinates for all the nodes in the grid
% Y: y-coordinates for all the nodes in the grid
