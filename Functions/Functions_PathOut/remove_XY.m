function [X, Y] = remove_XY(X, Y, parking_size, chosen_points, angles, road_width)
% Purpose: remove coordinates from the grid, which overlap with the chosen
% points
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
% X: a vector containing the X-coordinates of the nodes
% Y: a vector containing the Y-coordinates of the nodes
% parking_size: the dimension of the parking slots
% chosen_points: the points chosen to have removed grid around them
% angles: a vector containing all the slots angle
% road_width: the width of the road

%% OUTPUT
% X: a vector containing the X-coordinates of the nodes
% Y: a vector containing the Y-coordinates of the nodes
