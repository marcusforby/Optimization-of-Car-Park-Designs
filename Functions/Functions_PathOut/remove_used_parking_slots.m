function [first_point, points] = remove_used_parking_slots(path, first_point, end_point, X, Y, points)
% Purpose: remove parking slots which have been chosen
% Authors: Marcus FÃ¸rby & Oscar J. Andersen

%% INPUT
% path: a list of the parking-slots to be removed
% first_point: the points which represents the parking slots in the grid
% end_point: the points which can get out
% X: a vector containing the X-coordinates of the nodes
% Y: a vector containing the Y-coordinates of the nodes
% points: the center points of the placed parking slots
% parking_size: the dimension of the parking slots

%% OUTPUT
% first_point_out: the points which represents the parking slots in the
% grid

%% CODE
